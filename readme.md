# This is a simple Podman setup script for the Gotify service

This script will initialize a podman pod with required containers to run your own
instance of the [Gotify](https://github.com/gotify/server) service.  

This script needs very little configuration - only really to congiure your desired ports (i.e. HTTP and SSH ports)  

You will need to set up your own Reverse Proxy and TLS certificates
